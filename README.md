# Test Operator
This is a test operator that automates testing of an OpenStack deployment
running on an OpenShift cluster. The operator supports execution of the following
tests:

- [Tempest](https://opendev.org/openstack/tempest)

- [Tobiko](https://tobiko.readthedocs.io/en/master)

- [Horizon tests](https://opendev.org/openstack/horizon)

- Arbitrary tests written as an Ansible role (refer to **AnsibleTest CR**)

## Getting Started
First, you will need an OpenStack Platform running on top of OpenShift. See:

- [ci-framework documentation](https://ci-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or

- [install_yamls GitHub repository](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls/blob/main/README.md)

to get you started. It will get you through the installation of such environment.

Then proceed to our [documentation](https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/test-operator/).

## Contributing
Please, make sure that pre-commit checks pass prior to proposing a PR.

1. Install pre-commit tool

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

2. Execute pre-commit checks

```bash
pre-commit run --show-diff-on-failure --color=always --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --verbose
```

### Test It Out
Run the following commands if you want to quickly test your test-operator related
changes locally.

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new
   terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false make install run`
